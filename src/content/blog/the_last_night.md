“*I’m tired!*”, cried Bruno, “*Anymore work and I will lose my mind!*”

“*Looks like you’ve already lost it, kid. Farm’s all that you’ve got to keep both of us alive*”, said Sophie in her usual condescending tone. 

She had been his only hope to stay alive, after their parents had passed away 5 years ago. With not a lot in the will, all Bruno and Sophie shared was a tiny cottage in the village and a 5 acre farm that gave them enough to afford a square meal. The animals had been sold off to clear debts and Bruno’s life had been sold off to the farm.


“*This is not what I had imagined my life to be and you know it Sophie! I want to do more in life. Go to the city, get myself literate, settle down, I need to……*”, Bruno exclaimed but after looking at his sister’s disappointed face, he could say no more. 

“*If you don’t want to be a part of this house, you can leave…*", said Sophie, her pale blue dress that had been mended at many places, looked even more dull.


“*But remember, right now I’m all you’ve got*”.


It was cloudy outside the next day. The breeze blew across the tall grass, sliding gently past the chimes, making soft cries and mild bellows. No sooner, did Bruno go outside to check on the paddy did it begin to rain wildly against a coming storm. 

“*Hurry! Cover the ceiling Sophie! Looks like the paddies have gotten lucky today*”, Bruno yelled from outside the door. Sophie quickly took a blue plastic sheet and covered the ceiling with it.


”*Heavy rain today, eh?*" said Sophie, closing the door behind as Bruno entered to warm himself near the fireplace.

“*Downpours are always welcome for farmers, sister!*”

“*Tea..?*” Sophie offered when a hard knock was heard against the door. 

“*Who’s it?*” asked Bruno.

“*I-….I’m lost and need some shelter*” replied a meek voice from behind the door. The siblings exchanged glances and soon after Bruno opened the door, he found the most beautiful maiden he had ever laid his eyes upon, standing afore him.
 
"*Bruno, who is it?*” Sophie asked after a moment or two. 

The beautiful stranger peeped inside, “*Can I come in? It’s raining heavily outside and there’s no place to seek shelter here, other than your hut*”.

Bruno stood near the door, speechless and mesmerized, and even though she made constant attempts to talk, he did not utter.

“*Oh for Lord’s sake, Bruno!*”, Sophie cried as she came near the door and nudged her younger brother.

“*I’m sorry, something‘s gone utterly wrong with him; my dear, come inside*”, Sophie led the stranger into the cottage and Bruno followed.

“*He’s not used to seeing girls*”, joked Sophie, hearing which the stranger let out a genuine laugh and Bruno a groan. 

“*My name is Janet. I’ve come from the other side of the woods. I got lost on my way to the lakeside and now I’m stranded here.*”

“*That’s all right; you can stay until you find your way back. Bruno here, my baby brother will help you out*”, Sophie said with a chuckle and was joined by the beauty.

“*Don’t sway. She’s always been like that to me since I was young. I’ll help you find your way back to the woods by ‘morrow*”, Bruno retaliated.

“*I’m just being nice, Bruno. Till then, miss, help yourself with some tea and you can change to my clothes for tonight. Seems like yours have given up*”, Sophie said offering her utmost hospitality to the guest.

That night, wasn’t the same for Bruno. He could not help thinking how pretty Janet was, her hazel eyes and dark brown hair were all that he thought about. Sophie had gone to sleep early.

“*I…I’ve …I’m….Do you…?*” Bruno gathered all courage to speak to Janet.

"*I would love to know more about you…*”, Bruno blushed like never before when all of a sudden, she came near and planted a gentle kiss on his cheek. He nearly passed away.

“*Well, seems like I’d love to know more about you too.* ”


It had been quite magical, surreal and something Bruno had never imagined. It was almost as if he could see his dream breathing alive in front of him. The next morning might have been the most awaited one for Bruno; for all he had woke up to in his life so far, were the farm and Sophie. This time, it was different because this time, it was Janet.  


****

*Good morning Sunshine! Time to go home, I suppose?*” Sophie woke Janet up and prepared some poach and bread. 

“*Won’t baby brother leave her there?*”, she mocked.

“*Stop that I say, Sophie. It’s got on my nerves now*", Bruno flushed with anger and then looked at Janet. 

“*Excuse me! I’ll be back with the logs for the fireplace.*”, he said, annoyed with his sister’s constant efforts to embarrass him in front of Janet. 
Bruno rushed outside. 

“*Why does she always have to do that with me? I wonder what Janet must be thinking*”, he pondered, forgetting to take his axe along. 

“*Never mind him, he doesn’t have to get annoyed that fast, does he?*”, Sophie exclaimed, reassuring  that she was only joking around.

“*Well, Sophie I must say, that you go a little too far with your statements.*”, Janet replied, sitting on the old oak chair near the fireplace. 

“*What do you mean, Janet*?” asked Sophie grudgingly from near the kitchen table, her back turned towards the fireplace. She could hear Janet’s footsteps that were slowly approaching her.

“*I mean…After all he does so much for you, Sophie*”, said Janet in a tone that she had never used before. 

Meanwhile, Bruno, on his way to the plantations, realized that in his fury, he had left his axe behind and without it, his venture further into the plantations would be worthless. 

“*All the way down here and without the axe, I have to turn back now*”, thought Bruno. 

The walk back home seemed, however, unusually long. Something had started bothering him.  He was supposed to leave Janet back today and he was not excited. Would they ever meet again? It troubled his mind every now and then. 

“*She lives on the other side of the woods.*”, Bruno thought again. He had never been there but he had heard about the place, long ago. He, however, did not remember what he had been told.

He tried recalling it again and again, until he reached the doorsteps. He knocked on the door but all he heard was the rustling of leaves of a nearby bush. Neither did Sophie open the door nor was there any response from within the hut.  Hurriedly Bruno knocked harder, only this time to discover the door was not locked. He swung the door open and called out for Sophie. There was no one in the tiny room. He quickly looked inside the bedroom but could not find anyone there either. Confused, Bruno turned around to see Janet standing behind him.


“*Janet, thank goodness, you are here. I thought, for a moment, somebody broke in and found....*” , he paused.

”*Where’s Sophie?*”

Janet did not reply but only looked at him yearningly. 

“*Janet? Where is Sophie?*” Bruno asked. 

“*Janet, why aren’t you talking?*” he asked again, this time shaking her arms.

She was cold. He not only felt so but also noticed it in her eyes. She gave a scowl. 

**"Oh !”**  Bruno cried when he noticed a part of her cloak drenched in blood. He ran towards the kitchen only to find Sophie sitting clumsily on the old oak chair. She did not move. 

“*Sophie?* ....Sophie!?”, Bruno cried louder as he approached his sister only to see her as pale as never before.

“*Janet…*”, Bruno turned pale.

“*I’ve done the work. Now let’s get out before anybody notices*”, Janet said quietly.

“*Oh! But they will come looking. You have to leave. I’ll need to handle it from here on. After 'tis settled, I’ll sell everything and we’ll leave for the city.*”, said Bruno, his eyes filled with tears . She could sense remorse in his voice.

“*Thank you*”, he choked. 

Janet smirked, planting a kiss on his cheek like she did last night.

**That night had changed Bruno, he had turned into something, Sophie could never have imagined.**
